We bought the prius today off a sound lad in Ballymun. The price of the prius was €1000, which 
is a great deal. There have not been any Priuses for sale for the same price on DoneDeal in
a while. It is in working condition... but it needs a bit of work before it is properly
roadworthy 😅

The idea is that we should be able to regain a significant portion of the inital investment by 
selling the engine, hybrid battery and other unneeded parts. Even if we can't, it's still a
cool project 😁 We are still awaiting a good name 🤔
