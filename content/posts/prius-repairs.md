The Prius has a few problems that must be fixed in order to make it road
worthy. Here is a list of everything to be repaired:

### Major mechanical repairs ⚠️

- Steering rack
- Bushings
- New tyres

The steering rack is the most evident problem. There is at least a 30 degree
angle that the steering wheel can be rotated through without any steering! 
The local mechanic also recommended to replace the worn bushings and tyres.

### Minor cosmetic repairs 💅

- Driver seat cover repair (Holes covered by teddies)
- Centre armrest piece is secured with velcro because of broken clip
- Back left bumper panel broken and bent in above wheel arch
- Right overhead light switch is dodgy
- Fix lever at the right of the driver seat
