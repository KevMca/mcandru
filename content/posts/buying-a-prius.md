We bought the prius today off a lad in Ballymun. It cost €1000, which 
is a great deal. There have not been any Priuses for sale for the same price on DoneDeal in
a while. It is in working condition... but it needs a bitteen of work before it is properly
roadworthy 😅

The idea is that we should be able to regain a significant portion of the inital investment by 
selling the engine, hybrid battery and other unneeded parts. Even if we can't, it's still an
interesting project. We are still awaiting a good name 🤔
