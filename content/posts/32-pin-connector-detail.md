21. **GIVT : MG1 inverter temperature**

- Min.: -50Â°C, Max.: 205Â°C
- The lower the motor temperature, the higher the resistance of the thermistor
- Conversely, the higher the temperature, the lower the resistance.
- (found on page HV-189)
- "The power voltage of 5 V is
supplied from the MMT terminal of the HV control ECU to the No. 1 motor temperature sensor via resistor
R. Because resistor R and the No. 1 motor temperature sensor are connected in series, the resistance
changes with the changes in temperature of the motor, which causes the MMT terminal voltage to also
change."
