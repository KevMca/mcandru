I wasn't happy with the power that I was getting from the motor. Furthermore, it wasn't as smooth as I
would have liked. Field Oriented Control (FOC) can alleviate these problems. I have gone through the
theory of FOC control in [FOC control theory](/motor-control). There is also a good video by vedder himself
on the topic: [vedder video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYYNbxPXNEU&t=343s). The controller I am
using is a Vedder Electronic Speed Controller or Vedder ESC or VESC, which is basically a standard ESC that
is open source and developed by Benjamin Vedder.

### Hall effect sensors üî¨

Hall effect sensors are used for position control. These sensors are particularly important for estimating
rotor position when the motor is stationary. I think the VESC that I'm using uses Back EMF sensing at high
speeds anyways because it's more accurate. However, hall sensors work well independent of speed. When
a pole is seen the output latches until the opposite pole is seen. I thought that these hall sensor ICs
had a voltage output, but it actually acts more like a switch, so an external voltage must be applied to
test them.

Long story short, just connect power ground and the three hall sensor wires to the VESC and you're good to
go üòÖ

### BLDC tool setup ‚öôÔ∏è

The steps for using the BLDC tool are as follows:

1. Connect hall sensors
2. Select hall sensors at top and click detect hall sensors 
    - *the motor spins and detects their position*
3. Measure R (resistance) and L (inductance)
    - *used to compensate for the electrical characteristics of the motor*
    - *the motor vibrates*
4. Measure lambda
    - *lambda is the flux linkage which indicates the concentration of the magnetic field inside the motor*
    - *the motor vibrates and then spins up*
5. Calculate current control (CC) coefficients
    - *ki and kp are the PID Parameters*
6. Apply all measurements

##### Parameters

- Current control: Kp, Ki
- Speed tracker: Kp, Ki
- Duty downramp: Kp, Ki
- R (resistance of the motor coils)
- L (inductance of the motor coils)
- Lambda (flux linkage)
- Observer gain (observer is used to determine the angle of the rotor for FOC)
- F_SW (switching frequency of the PWM )
- DTc (deadband time) (if stays still for openloop hyst time it'll run with openloop RPM for openloop time)
    - *Openloop RPM*
    - *Open loop hyst*
    - *Open loop time*
- D current injection: Duty, Factor
- CC (current control loop)

### Increasing power ‚ö°

The power was still limited after setting up FOC. I did a bit of testing. The BLDC tool has some nice
graphing and data acquisition tools with it. So I tested the maximum power output in a stall.

The problem was that the motor current was limited to 30 amps. Which means the maximum power was 
30A\*50V=1.5kW peak. This... is not enough üòà I want more power!!! ‚ö° So I increased the motor current
limit to 60A which means the motor can now have peak power of 60A\*50V=3kW. Much better üòä I could have 
increased the limit even more, however the battery current limit was reached at 10A and I did not
want to exceed 10A. I believe the motor current can exceed the battery current because the controller
has large capacitors that store energy for when there is a peak in power consumption from the motor.
This decreases stress on the motor.
