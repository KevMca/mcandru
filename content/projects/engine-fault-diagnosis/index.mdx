  ### About
  ---

  I am currently completing an MCS in Computer Science. My masters dissertation is on __Engine Fault Detection__
  using audio analysis. The goal of the project is to find out, to what degree can Internal Combustion Engine health 
  can be determined by using a smartphone microphone.

  The idea originated from a tappet sound on my infamous 2002 Audi TT. At the time, I didn't have enough knowledge or experience
  in the field to identify the sound. However, an expert mechanic could instantly identify the tappet sound and recommend a fix.

  At the most basic level, this project could prove useful to create a tool that identifies basic faults for a non-mechanic. If
  the project is more successful, it may very well be able to identify faults from sound that even an expert mechanic is unable
  to notice.

    <TimelineItem title="RPM Detection" status="Completed" date="12.10.2020" type="normal">
      To acquaint myself with audio analysis techniques, my first task is to determine the RPM
      of the engine from its sound. I opted to perform a Fast Fourier Transform on the audio
      and find the fundamental frequency of the cylinders firing to determine the RPM.

    <TimelineItem title="Misfire Detection" status="Completed" date="27.10.2020" type="normal">
      Misfires occur when the fuel and air mixture in a cylinder doesn't combust. This can be
      caused by spark plug, injector or coilpack faults. To find a misfire, I used a Fast Fourier
      Transform and used harmonics of the fundamental frequency of the cylinders and the presence
      of intermediate frequencies between the harmonic frequencies to determine a misfire.

    <TimelineItem title="Relative Compression" status="In progress" type="normal">
      My next challenge is to analyse the sound of the starter motor turning an engine over to
      determine low compression in a cylinder. The idea is that if there is low compression in
      a cylinder, less load is put on the starter motor allowing it to spin faster with a
      noticable difference in sound.
