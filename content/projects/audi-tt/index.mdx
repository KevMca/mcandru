  ### About
  ---

  Last year I bought a 2002 Audi TT, 225bhp with 151,000 miles for â‚¬400. Naturally, it needed some work.
  Initially, I thought it wouldn't take much to get the car back on the road. However, several trips to
  the garage later, I came to the realisation that in order for this car to become reliable again, I would
  need to do some restoration work.

  I thought a Volkwagen Golf derived, "People's Car" would be an easy introduction to car restoration. 
  Boy was I wrong.

      The steering rack failed and as a result the subframe needed to be dropped to remove and replace it.
      An assessment was made of the condition of the front axle assembly in the process of doing this. 
      I decided that the subframe, control arms, steering rack and anti-roll bar would require work and were all removed.

        <span>
          A hole in the exhaust system was causing a loud tractor-like blowing sound. I removed the exhaust
          system and found that the flexible hose on the downpipe had rusted through.
        </span>

        <span>
          Rust damage on the exhaust side of the engine made removing the turbo impossible without engine
          removal. After the engine was removed, the rust damage was assessed and I determined that a new turbo
          would be required.

    <TimelineItem title="Turbo Removal" status="Completed" date="27.07.2020" type="normal">
      Rust damage made removing the turbo difficult but it did come undone. The turbo had significant shaft
      play and worn oil seals which resulted in oil leaking to the intake. It definitely needed replacing.

    <TimelineItem title="Subframe and Control Arm Restoration" status="Completed" date="09.09.2020" type="normal">
      <div>
        <img src={TTNewSubframe} style={{ maxWidth: 250, marginTop: 0, marginRight: 20, float: 'left' }} />
        <span>
          Surface rust was removed and the surfaces were lightly sanded. Several coats of "Hammered Black" hammerite
          were applied to provide a tough protective layer.

    <TimelineItem title="Cylinder Head Cover Gasket" status="Completed" type="normal" date="30.09.2020">
      The cylinder head cover gasket was seeping and is in need of replacement. It is also a good excuse to
      have a look at the condition of the cams, cam chain and lifters.

    <TimelineItem title="Engine Reinstallation" status="Completed" type="normal" date="25.12.2020">
      The much antipicated engine reinstallation went as smoothly as one could hope and went in on its new engine
      mounts without much coaxing.
      <div>
        <img src={EngineIn} style={{ maxWidth: 300, margin: 10 }} />
        <img src={AfterEngineIn} style={{ maxWidth: 300, margin: 10 }} />

    <TimelineItem title="Exhaust Reassembly" status="Completed" type="normal" date="14.11.2020">
      <div>

        <span>
          I had some difficulty with the cheap downpipe and midpipe as expected. The midpipe was slightly too small to
          allow the exhaust clamp to grip it so I had to fabricate a shim to slide between the pipe and the clamp. Hopefully
          it doesn't blow too loudly.

    <TimelineItem title="Front Axle Reassembly" status="Completed" type="normal" date="31.12.2020">
      The subframe and new steering rack are reinstalled along with the exhaust adjustment. The exhaust
      is a very tight fit and I suspect that there will be significant rubbing once the car is on the
      ground. However, it will suffice for the first start and I may purchase a better quality exhaust
      for better fitment.
    </TimelineItem>
    <TimelineItem title="Engine First Start Preparation" status="Completed" type="normal" date="23.01.2021">
      The cooling system and power steering system were reinstalled, a once over of all fittings
      and hoses were completed and fluids added before the first start of the engine again.
    </TimelineItem>
    <TimelineItem title="First Start" status="Completed" type="normal" date="23.01.2021" posts={["tt-first-start", "tt-fluid-bleeding"]}>
      Couldn't have had a better first start! Started up without any hesitation. No need to buy another exhaust either
      as there doesn't seem to be any rubbing.

        <img src={TTWashMe} style={{ maxWidth: 300, margin: 10 }} />

    <TimelineItem title="First Start" status="Completed" type="normal" date="24.01.2021">
      After reassembling the rest of the front suspension, we took it out for a quick test on the driveway and it
      was perfect. Unfortunately, we can't take it any further until it passes NCT inspection.

    </TimelineItem>
    <TimelineItem title="Cleaning and tracking" status="Completed" type="normal" date="28.01.2021">
      The car has got its bumpers, plastic coverings and wheel arch liners fitted back as well as rim inserts. It got a tracking
      and alignment as well as balancing of the wheels at a local shop and is now ready for the NCT.
      <div style={{ maxWidth: 600 }}>
        <img src={TTWashed} style={{ width: '100%' }} />
      </div>
    </TimelineItem>
    <TimelineItem title="NCT Technical Inspection Attempt #1" status="Completed" type="normal" date="09.02.2021">
      <div style={{ maxWidth: 400 }}>
        <img src={TTNCTAttempt1} style={{ width: '100%' }} />
      </div>
      The car failed the NCT the first go round. They failed it on emissions. The car was running too rich which is possibly down to
      a couple of things:<br/><br/>
      1. There is no catalytic converter<br/><br/>
      2. There is an intermittant misfire<br/><br/>
      3. The engine is running a bit cold because the thermostat is open fully all the time<br/><br/>
    </TimelineItem>
    <TimelineItem title="NCT Fixes" status="Completed" type="normal" date="07.03.2021" posts={["tt-nct-jobs"]}>
      To get the car to pass the NCT:<br/><br/>
      1. Removed the straight back downpipe. I purchased a downpipe that fit the original catalytic
      converter and I'm going to fit that to the car instead.<br/><br/>
      2. Replaced all exhaust gaskets so that there are no exhaust leaks causing the engine to run rich.<br/><br/>
      3. Replaced the thermostat and temperature sensor.<br/><br/>
    </TimelineItem>
    <TimelineItem title="NCT Technical Inspection Attempt #2" status="Completed" type="end" date="11.03.2021">
      And...it passed the test with flying colours. One annoying quirk of the NCT is that it's only given a valid cert until
      when the NCT was due, not when it was tested so I'm going to have to repeat the process again in November. Still 8 months
      of roadworthiness is not too bad.
