  ### About
  ---

  Last year I bought a 2002 Audi TT, 225bhp with 151,000 miles for â‚¬400. Naturally, it needed some work.
  Initially, I thought it wouldn't take much to get the car back on the road. However, several trips to
  the garage later, I came to the realisation that in order for this car to become reliable again, I would
  need to do some restoration work.

  I thought a Volkwagen Golf derived, "People's Car" would be an easy introduction to car restoration. 
  Boy was I wrong.

    <TimelineItem title="Front Axle Disassembly" status="Completed" date="11.04.2020" type="normal">
      The steering rack failed and as a result the subframe needed to be dropped to remove and replace it.
      An assessment was made of the condition of the front axle assembly in the process of doing this. 
      I decided that the subframe, control arms, steering rack and anti-roll bar would require work and were all removed.

    <TimelineItem title="Exhaust System Disassembly" status="Completed" date="18.04.2020" type="normal">
      A hole in the exhaust system was causing a loud tractor-like blowing sound. I removed the exhaust
      system and found that the flexible hose on the downpipe had rusted through.
    </TimelineItem>
    <TimelineItem title="Engine Removal" status="Completed" date="18.07.2020" type="normal">
      Rust damage on the exhaust side of the engine made removing the turbo impossible without engine
      removal. After the engine was removed, the rust damage was assessed and I determined that a new turbo
      would be required.
    </TimelineItem>
    <TimelineItem title="Turbo Removal" status="Completed" date="27.07.2020" type="normal">
      Rust damage made removing the turbo difficult but it did come undone. The turbo had significant shaft
      play and worn oil seals which resulted in oil leaking to the intake. It definitely needed replacing.
    </TimelineItem>
    <TimelineItem title="Subframe and Control Arm Restoration" status="Completed" date="09.09.2020" type="normal">
      Surface rust was removed and the surfaces were lightly sanded. Several coats of "Hammered Black" hammerite
      were applied to provide a tough protective layer.
    </TimelineItem>
    <TimelineItem title="Turbo Replacement" status="In progress" type="normal">
      I tried to get the original turbo rebuilt but it could not due to cracking on the cast iron turbine housing.
      Instead, I opted to buy a new aftermarket turbo as close to the OEM as possible. The turbo has arrived and
      I am going to fit it very soon.
    </TimelineItem>
    <TimelineItem title="Cylinder Head Cover Gasket" status="Completed" type="normal" date="30.09.2020">
      The cylinder head cover gasket was seeping and is in need of replacement. It is also a good excuse to
      have a look at the condition of the cams, cam chain and lifters.
    </TimelineItem>
    <TimelineItem title="Engine Reinstallation" status="Not started" type="normal">
      After the turbo, cylinder head cover gasket and front axle assembly have been reinstalled, the engine can be refitted.
    </TimelineItem>
    <TimelineItem title="Exhaust Reassembly" status="In progress" type="normal">
      The new exhaust downpipe can be fitted when the engine is reinstalled.
    </TimelineItem>
    <TimelineItem title="Front Axle Reassembly" status="In progress" type="end">
      The subframe, new steering rack and control arms can be reinstalled once the exhaust is back in
      place. I am going to assemble the axle assembly before reinstalling the engine in the car.
