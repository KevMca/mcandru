    Nature is class. Birds are also class. If you have ever seen a bird gliding in the wind, 
    that is exactly what this project is trying to emulate. The world record flight time for 
    a two-seat glider is over 70 hours set in 1961 in Hawaii. This record has not been between 
    because it is seen as being a pointless and dangerous challenge. Alpine swifts can fly 
    for 6 months at a time without landing in fact.

    So it is not too crazy to imagine building an autonomous glider that can remain airborne 
    for large periods of time. To do this, a stable control system and suite of algorithms is 
    required.
