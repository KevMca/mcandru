      I bought my hub motor from aliexpress so I could get the best price. There is no need for the full wheel,
      so I bought the motor by itself. It cost about ‚Ç¨137.28 for a 48V 1500W motor. Motor arrived on 11th September.

      All of the electronics are setup, so it's a matter of just plugging everything and seeing how well it works.

      I have two old rear wheels, one of which was destroyed by the last motor, the other has a bent rim.
      I can use parts from both of these to build a new wheel around the hub motor.

      A new wheel needs to be built from the scavenged spokes and rims of my old wheels.

      The hub motor needs to be balanced to run smooth. This can be done with some tape and coins. This is not
      strictly necessary, but it is a nice touch.

      The current compartment for the electronics looks ugly and can be improved. The battery needs to be secured
      in place and new light-weight wooden panels need to be made.

      The Hub motor comes with a casette mount for the pedal chain. I only have freewheels however, so I'll have
      to buy and install this.

      The power of the hub motor is decent, but performance could probably be improved by adding position sensors
      to the wheel and by using Field Oriented Control (FOC).

      I bought a BMS for the battery that I have a while ago. However, the BMS was faulty. I have a new one that I
      have been meaning to install for a while. It's finally installed now üòä

      There are lights on the bike that have their own battery, but why not run them off the bike's battery üòÅ I got
      a 12V motorbike headlight and LED rear light from banggood along with a 12V regulator

 I have built a number of electric bikes in the past:

V1: Nissan Almera windscreen wiper motor and switch V2: Hobby BLDC motor, VESC controller and soldered battery V3: Same as V2 with better motor mount and modular battery

My new electric bike is an upgrade to the third version (V4). I am upgrading the motor and compartment for the electronics. The old motor mount broke which pulled the motor into the wheel and broke all the spokes üò¨ So I decided to upgrade to a hub motor üòä The electronics compartment will have a mix of plastic and wood panels.
