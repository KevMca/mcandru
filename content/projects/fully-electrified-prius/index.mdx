  ### About
  ---

  The initial idea was to take use two scrapped cars to make a new and improved one. An electric 
  car scrapped for structural damage could give cheap electronics and an ICE non-runner would provide 
  a new home for the electronics. 
  Before we do this however, we want to start smaller. Letâ€™s convert a Prius to all-electric. Along 
  the way we have to get a Prius, do some mechanical work, convert to plug in hybrid, hack inverter 
  and finally convert to full electric.
