  ### About
  ---

  I have built a number of electric bikes in the past:
  
  **V1:** *Nissan Almera windscreen wiper motor and switch*
  **V2:** *Hobby BLDC motor, VESC controller and soldered battery*
  **V3:** *Same as V2 with better motor mount and modular battery*

  My new electric bike is an upgrade to the third version (V4). I am upgrading the motor and compartment for the
  electronics. The old motor mount broke which pulled the motor into the wheel and broke all the spokes ðŸ˜¬ So I
  decided to upgrade to a hub motor ðŸ˜Š The electronics compartment will have a mix of plastic and wood panels.

    <TimelineItem title="Buy a new hub motor" status="Completed" date="11.8.2020" type="normal"
        posts={["hub-motor-shopping"]}>
      I bought my hub motor from aliexpress so I could get the best price. There is no need for the full wheel,
      so I bought the motor by itself. It cost about â‚¬137.28 for a 48V 1500W motor. Motor arrived on 11th September.

    <TimelineItem title="Test hub motor" status="Completed" date="15.9.2020" type="normal">
      All of the electronics are setup, so it's a matter of just plugging everything and seeing how well it works.

    <TimelineItem title="Scavenge old wheels for parts" status="Completed" date="14.8.2020" type="normal">
      I have two old rear wheels, one of which was destroyed by the last motor, the other has a bent rim. I can
      use parts from both of these to build a new wheel around the hub motor.

      A new wheel needs to be built from the scavenged spokes and rims of my old wheels.

    <TimelineItem title="Balance the wheel" status="Completed" date="23.9.2020" type="normal">
      The hub motor needs to be balanced to run smooth. This can be done with some tape and coins. This is not
      strictly necessary, but it is a nice touch.

    <TimelineItem title="Build the wooden panels" status="Completed" date="29.9.2020" type="normal"
        posts={["new-compartment"]}>
      The current compartment for the electronics looks ugly and can be improved. The battery needs to be secured
      in place and new light-weight wooden panels need to be made.

    <TimelineItem title="Buy and install casette" status="Not started" type="normal">
      The Hub motor comes with a casette mount for the pedal chain. I only have freewheels however, so I'll have
      to buy and install this.

    <TimelineItem title="Hook up the hall effect sensors" status="Not started" type="normal">
      The power of the hub motor is decent, but performance could probably be improved by adding position sensors
      to the wheel.

    <TimelineItem title="Add BMS to the battery" status="Not started" type="normal">
      I bought a BMS for the battery that I have a while ago. However, the BMS was faulty. I have a new one that
      I have been meaning to install for a while.

    <TimelineItem title="Install battery-run lights" status="Not started" type="end">
      There are lights on the bike that have their own battery, but why not run them off the bike's battery :)
