      First of all, we need a Prius! We managed to find a fantastic deal on DoneDeal.

      The Prius we got has some issues with it. The steering rack is loose and very dangerous, there are many
      cosmetic faults and there is other maintenance like new tyres and bushings that must be completed.

      Now that we have a roadworthy Prius, we can convert the car to a Plug-in Hybrid. The battery in the Prius
      is too small, so this must be modified. A charger is needed to charge said battery also. All this must be done
      while keeping the rest of the car happy :D

      We should have a Plug-in Hybrid Vehicle by now. This means that the battery system in the car should be suitable
      for charging and running on all-electric power for long distances. The Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) can be removed.
      Now that the engine is removed, both motors can be used to drive the car. We need to maximise the power from these
      motors also.

The initial idea was to take use two scrapped cars to make a new and improved one. An electric car scrapped for structural damage could give cheap electronics and an ICE non-runner would provide a new home for the electronics. Before we do this however, we want to start smaller. Letâ€™s convert a Prius to all-electric. Along the way we have to get a Prius, do some mechanical work, convert to plug in hybrid, hack inverter and finally convert to full electric.
