  How to create an accurate real-world ruler in CSS.

  CSS has "absolute units" like cm, mm, in, pt and pc. However, these will map to completely
  different physical sizes, depending on the pixel density. For example, on my computer monitor 10mm appears
  as ~9mm, whereas on my phone it appears as ~5mm. This is a very large discrepency.

  One solution is to build a device-specific calibration step, that can cache the results once set up, to
  give you accurate measurements whenever loaded on your device in future.

  Calibration

  ZEISS have an interesting calibration test that uses a standard size card e.g. a credit card or ID (54mm) to figure out the size:
  https://www.zeiss.com/vision-care/en/eye-health-and-care/zeiss-online-vision-screening-check.html. However, it probably
  wouldn't be accurate enough for a ruler.

  The trick is to find a conversion constant (c), which can be found by: c = physical_size / virtual_size.

  We could still use the credit card trick, but use a more stringent series of steps to make the calibration process more accurate:

  1. Detect if the device is portrait or landscape. If the device is portrait, display the calibration box with the long side facing up.
    If the device is landscape, then do the opposite.
  
  2. Display a calibration box that's solid in colour, and provide a slider and fine-tuning buttons that will increase by very fine measurements
    e.g. 0.5mm. This will allow for better accuracy. The guide should say something like:
    
    "Increase the box size until the box colour can be seen over the edge of the card. Then reduce it by a point, and this is the correct distance".

  3. Optionally, include further calibration steps that use rules to match specific measurements. e.g. keep increasing the size until ruler reads 20mm.
    You can then compare the calculated values for c, and calculate an error rate in the calculations. If the error rate is above a threshold, ask them
    to recalibrate to get better precision.
